If you are reading this you're probably new to Code for New Hampshire. Maybe you came
here because you were sent here by a volunteer, or perhaps you were curious and searched
for "Does New Hampshire have a Code for America Brigade?" on Google.

Either way, welcome to Code for New Hampshire!

Code for New Hampshire is now an official code for America Brigade.

A brigade is a group of volunteers that bring community members together to make government work better. Brigades are involved in _Civic Hacking_.

Civis Hacking is a positive thing. It means building cool stuff quickly that benefits citizens and
makes the government more accessible to everyone. There is a long (but good) article on 
[codeforamerica.org: Defining Civic Hacking](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2013/06/07/defining-civic-hacking/).

### We Need Help

While we are official the work has just begun. We still need support from you and the comminity.

We need to fill all our key leadership roles:

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square-o"></i> Co-Captains</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square-o"></i> Delivery Leads (like a scrum master)</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square-o"></i> The Community Organizer</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square-o"></i> Story tellers (PR and social media)</li>
</ul>

And of course, we need local and government partners.

We are looking for a diverse group of people that represents the New Hampshire community well. From
organizers to engineers, renters to home owners, students to retirees, urban to rural, and natives to people who just moved here.

If you fit any of those, please contact us.
