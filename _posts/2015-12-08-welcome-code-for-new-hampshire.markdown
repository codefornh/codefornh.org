If you are reading this you're probably new to Code for New Hampshire. Maybe you came
here because you were sent here by a volunteer, or perhaps you were curious and searched
for "Does New Hampshire have a Code for America Brigade?" on Google.

Either way, welcome to Code for New Hampshire!

Code for New Hampshire is a unofficial (see below) Code for America Brigade, a group of volunteers
that bring community members together to make government work better. Brigades are involved
in _Civic Hacking_.

Civis Hacking is a positive thing. It means building cool stuff quickly that benefits citizens and
makes the government more accessible to everyone. There is a long (but good) article on 
[codeforamerica.org: Defining Civic Hacking](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2013/06/07/defining-civic-hacking/).

### Let's make it official

Code for New Hampshire is currently an unofficial brigade. There are a few things we need to
make it official:

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square-o"></i> A core team</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square-o"></i> A strategic plan</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square-o"></i> <a href="/docs/code-of-conduct.html">A code of conduct</a></li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square-o"></i> Community partners</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square-o"></i> Government partners</li>
</ul>

If you are a member of the community or the local New Hampshire state / town government you may
be able to help. We are looking for:

* Government partners
* Civic oriented community partners
* Coders
* Graphic artists
* Writers
* Project managers
* Story tellers

We are looking for a diverse group of people that represents the New Hampshire community well. From
organizers to engineers, renters to home owners, students to retirees, urban to rural, and natives to people who just moved here.

If you fit any of those, please contact us.
